	abstract = {The rapid spread in digital data usage in many real life applications have urged new and eﬀective ways to ensure their security. Eﬃcient secrecy can be achieved, at least in part, by implementing steganograhy techniques. Novel and versatile audio steganographic methods have been proposed. The goal of steganographic systems is to obtain secure and robust way to conceal high rate of secret data. We focus in this paper on digital audio steganography, which has emerged as a prominent source of data hiding across novel telecommunication technologies such as covered voice-over-{IP}, audio conferencing, etc. The multitude of steganographic criteria has led to a great diversity in these system design techniques. In this paper, we review current digital audio steganographic techniques and we evaluate their performance based on robustness, security and hiding capacity indicators. Another contribution of this paper is the provision of a robustness-based classiﬁcation of steganographic models depending on their occurrence in the embedding process. A survey of major trends of audio steganography applications is also discussed in this paper.},

In current generation, privacy related matters are of concern to every individual, that makes steganography to have an imperative role in real world applications. Audio signals are used as covers more frequently as compared with the other cover signals; the reason being their larger size so that more information can be concealed in the cover. Moreover, digital audio signals possess higher redundancy and high data transmission rate that make these suitable for used as covers. This work focuses on audio steganography based approaches that have effectuated attention from different researchers with its applicability to audio and speech signal processing for communicating information. In this work, different techniques, along with their algorithms and principles, useful in this regard are reviewed and a compendium to digital audio steganography is presented. Additionally, a comparative study among the existing approaches has been provided along with a critical review that can help the community to investigate particular approach according to the requirement.},

The algorithm uses perfect reconstruction filterbanks and embeds additional information inside wavelet domain of audio signal by modifying {LSB} values of wavelet coefficients. Objective and subjective tests show large advantage of the proposed method over time insertion method. For the same {SNR} values, proposed algorithm outperforms classical {LSB} algorithm by 150-200 kbps of hidden data. Subjective experiments showed that wavelet domain information hiding scheme is acoustically more transparent as well.},

	abstract = {Audio steganography aims at concealing secret information in carrier audio with imperceptible modiﬁcation on the carrier. Although previous works addressed the robustness of concealed message recovery against distortions introduced during transmission, they do not address the robustness against aggressive editing such as mixing of other audio sources and source separation. In this work, we propose for the ﬁrst time a steganography method that can embed information into individual sound sources in a mixture such as instrumental tracks in music. To this end, we propose a time-domain model and curriculum learning essential to learn to decode the concealed message from the separated sources. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully conceals the information in an imperceptible perturbation and that the information can be correctly recovered even after mixing of other sources and separation by a source separation algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be applied to multiple sources simultaneously without interfering with the decoder for other sources even after the sources are mixed and separated.},

	abstract = {Steganography comprises the mechanics of hiding data in a host media that may be publicly available. While previous works focused on unimodal setups (e.g., hiding images in images, or hiding audio in audio), {PixInWav} targets the multimodal case of hiding images in audio. To this end, we propose a novel residual architecture operating on top of short-time discrete cosine transform ({STDCT}) audio spectrograms. Among our results, we ﬁnd that the residual audio steganography setup we propose allows independent encoding of the hidden image from the host audio without compromising quality. Accordingly, while previous works require both host and hidden signals to hide a signal, {PixInWav} can encode images ofﬂine — which can be later hidden, in a residual fashion, into any audio signal. Finally, we test our scheme in a lab setting to transmit images over airwaves from a loudspeaker to a microphone verifying our theoretical insights and obtaining promising results.},

	abstract = {The widespread application of audio communication technologies has speeded up audio data ﬂowing across the Internet, which made it a popular carrier for covert communication. In this paper, we present a cross-modal steganography method for hiding image content into audio carriers while preserving the perceptual ﬁdelity of the cover audio. In our framework, two multi-stage networks are designed: the ﬁrst network encodes the decreasing multilevel residual errors inside different audio subsequences with the corresponding stage sub-networks, while the second network decodes the residual errors from the modiﬁed carrier with the corresponding stage sub-networks to produce the ﬁnal revealed results. The multi-stage design of proposed framework not only make the controlling of payload capacity more ﬂexible, but also make hiding easier because of the gradual sparse characteristic of residual errors. Qualitative experiments suggest that modiﬁcations to the carrier are unnoticeable by human listeners and that the decoded images are highly intelligible.},
