keywords = {pitch, critical bands, physiology of the ear, loudness, frequency weighting networks, noise curves, masking, articulation, time averaging, binaural sound},
abstract = {Chapter 3 discusses the mechanisms of human hearing including a description of the ear (its physiology and anatomy), the perception of pitch, loudness, speech intelligibility, annoyance, health and safety considerations, and other acoustical effects. There are detailed discussions of various phenomena including perception of level, direction, binaural sound, background noise standards (including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards) and echoes. Metrics are discussed including time averaging, 24-hour levels, speech intelligibility, and thresholds of perception.}
